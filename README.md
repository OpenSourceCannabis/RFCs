# Cannabis RFCs

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a
consistent platform for collaboration aimed to improve, introduce or request anything (best practices, standardizations, APIs, data models, protocols, enumerations, shared libraries) that can benefit the cannabis information technology industry.

## Gathering feedback before submitting

It's often helpful to get feedback on your concept before diving into the level of detail required for an RFC. **You may open an issue on this repo to start a high-level discussion**, with the goal of eventually formulating an RFC pull request with the specific implementation design.

## The process

* Create a topic branch, example ```et/seed-to-sale-authentication```
* Copy `0000-template.md` to `content/0000-my-feature.md` (where
'my-feature' is descriptive. don't assign an RFC number yet).
* Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details: **RFCs that do not
present convincing motivation, demonstrate understanding of the
impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or
alternatives tend to be poorly-received**.
* Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design
feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared
to revise it in response.
* Build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support
are much more likely to make progress than those that don't receive any
comments.
